# matplotlib-challenge
This repo contains all files and code associated with the Matplotlib homework assignment. 

In this project I generated summary tables and various plots (bar, pie, box and whisker, line, and scatter) to describe data from different treatments for skin cancer performed on mice. After that I performed a linear regression on tumor volume and mouse weight from mice on a specific drug regimen.

To run this code:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. In the `Pymaceuticals` directory open `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb` and run each cell of code.
